**SolarMonitor2: A New Era of Solar Data Monitoring**

For over two decades, SolarMonitor.org has been a go-to resource for near-real-time and archived solar data. From solar flares to coronal holes, the site served a variety of data products to the heliophysics community with reliability and dedication. But after 20+ years, even the most trusted tools can show their age.

### Why the Upgrade?

The original SolarMonitor (1.0) was built on outdated infrastructure — a patchwork of HTML/PHP pages, hardcoded image links, and IDL-based data processing. This architecture posed several issues:
- **High development overhead**: Tracking and fixing bugs was time-consuming and inefficient.
- **Limited scalability**: Adding new features or data sources was difficult.
- **Community limitations**: External contributions were hard to integrate, slowing down innovation.

Recognizing these challenges, the team at DIAS launched **SolarMonitor2**, a complete overhaul of the platform with modern technology at its core.

### What’s New in SolarMonitor2?

SolarMonitor2 represents a fresh, future-proof foundation for solar data services:

- **Containerized Infrastructure**: Built with Docker, the new system is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. It also enables seamless data communication via HTTP/JSON.
- **Modern Web Framework**: Leveraging Flask and nginx, SolarMonitor2 delivers a fast, responsive, and clean user interface.
- **Expanded Data Coverage**: With more data sources and processing capabilities, the platform offers hourly cadence full-disk images, active regions tracking, time series data, and solar event monitoring.
- **API Access**: Developers and researchers can now access data programmatically via a robust API (`solmon.dias.ie/api`).
- **Reliability and Automation**: Missing data is automatically filled in, ensuring minimal downtime and more consistent results.
- **Community Driven**: Open-source and hosted on GitHub, SolarMonitor2 invites feedback and contributions from the broader scientific community.

### What’s Next?

The alpha version is now live at [solmon.dias.ie](https://solmon.dias.ie), with ongoing development and new features being rolled out regularly. The team is actively seeking feedback and collaboration — whether you're a solar physicist, data scientist, or simply curious about space weather, your voice matters.

Join the journey as SolarMonitor enters its next chapter. Cleaner code. Smarter tools. A stronger community.
