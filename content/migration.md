**The SolarMonitor Migration: A New Dawn for Solar Data Access**

After more than two decades of service to the heliophysics community, **SolarMonitor** is entering a new era. The aging infrastructure of SolarMonitor (SM) is being replaced by a powerful, flexible, and modern platform: **SolarMonitor2 (SM2)**. 

This transition is more than just a facelift ‚Äî it's a re-engineering of how solar data is delivered, accessed, and utilized. And to ensure a smooth experience for users, the migration will take place in **three clear phases** from May 2025 through January 2026.

---

### üåû **Phase 1: May ‚Äì August 2025**  
**Goal:** Introduce users to SM2 while maintaining full access to SM.

- **solarmonitor.org** will continue to point to the current SolarMonitor (SM), but a **banner** will be added to every page announcing the upcoming changes and inviting users to explore the new system.
- **test.solarmonitor.org** will serve as the **preview site for SM2**, offering access to the updated interface, enhanced data offerings, and API documentation.

> This phase is all about transparency, stability, and giving users time to adapt.

---

### üöÄ **Phase 2: September ‚Äì December 2025**  
**Goal:** Transition SM2 as the primary platform while preserving legacy access.

- **solarmonitor.org** will now redirect to **SolarMonitor2**, officially making SM2 the main entry point for users.
- **old.solarmonitor.org** will be created to preserve access to the original SolarMonitor for those who still need legacy tools or data formats.

> This phase ensures continuity while encouraging full adoption of the new system.

---

### üåê **Phase 3: January 2026 and Beyond**  
**Goal:** Complete migration and streamline access.

- The original **SolarMonitor (SM)** will be **shut down**, and **all legacy URLs** will be permanently redirected to **SM2 at solarmonitor.org**.

> With SM2 fully live and maintained, users will benefit from modern features, faster performance, and expanded data access ‚Äî all from one streamlined portal.

### Why This Matters

SolarMonitor2 isn't just a newer version ‚Äî it's a complete rethinking of how solar data is processed, visualized, and shared:
- Faster, cleaner UI
- Expanded data sources and higher update cadence
- Programmatic API access
- Modular, container-based architecture built for the future

The transition is designed to be as seamless as possible, with thoughtful steps to keep the community informed and supported at every stage. Whether you're a long-time user or discovering SolarMonitor for the first time, now is the perfect time to explore what SM2 has to offer.
